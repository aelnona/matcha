A CLI epub reader for Linux with inline image support (mostly just for me, but here if anyone wants it)

- Depends on links, python3, imagemagick, unzip, xterm
- Requires a terminal with support for sixels (e.g. Xterm -ti vt340)

Tested in Alpine Linux, Debian, and Void Linux with Xterm using the Ash shell and Bash shell.

I've currently only tested it a few different books, but not extensively. A lot of files are probably not going to work as intended.  
I wrote this because I wanted an epub reader that I could use in the terminal, and still be able to view images. Sixels with imagemagick were the only way I could get inline images to work properly, and it was pretty convenient so I stuck with it.
